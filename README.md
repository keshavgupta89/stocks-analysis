# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Steve has invested his parents money is buying DQ stocks. We will analyze if its a good investment. And if not, which stock should we recommend him to buy for them.
### Purpose
We have to perform data analysis, which would be to go through all of Steve's stock data and use Excel formulas for calculations.We have to write code that will automate these analyses for us.
## Analysis and Challenges
After analysing the data, we have seen DQ stock was the least performing stock and gave a return of -62.6% in the year 2018. 
We would suggest Steve to invest the money in ENPH which gave a return of 82% in 2018 and 130% in 2017. It has been performing good consistently which you can see by the following tables.

## The advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general 
###The advantage of the refactoring code
1)Generally, refractoring is done by a different person than the person who has written the original code. Therefore its seen by a fresh set of eyes, which might find faults in code and improve it.
2)Code can get obsolete, because data might have changed. Therefore by refactoring code, we can have the data analyses updated
3)Most importantly we make the code more proficient in taking lesser time and adapting to changes in data.
###The disadvantage of the refactoring code
1)It takes time and money for improving/ refactoring a code.
2)It might altogther not work and have system failure or give incomplete analyses, if not done properly.
## The advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script
### The advantage of the original VBA script
The advantage of the original VBA script is that it becomes the base/platform on which refactoring can be done.
It gives us the first glance of the analyses and we can redirect our course of action, on immediate basis with that analysis.
### The disadvantage of the original VBA script
The biggest disadvantage of the original VBA script is that it takes a lot of time to run the analyses since it has not been refined.
### The advantage of the refactored VBA script
The advantage of the refactored VBA script is that it is a more effecient code taking lesser amount of time to analyse the same data. It can be updated to work with additional data.
In the above analyses we have refactored the VBA script such that, the code which was running 12 times through a 3000 rows of data now runs only once and take only 20% time of the original code.
### The disadvantage of the refactored VBA script
The disadvantage of the refactored VBA script is that it takes more time and effort of developer to refactor the code. There can be lot of bugs and error they might face during refactoring.
